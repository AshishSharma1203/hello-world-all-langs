/*
HISTORY OF IGBOS
The Igbo peopl, also spelled Ibo, and formerly also Iboe, Ebo, Eboe,
Eboans, Heebo; natively Ṇ́dị́ Ìgbò) are an ethnic group in Nigeria. 
They are primarily found in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo States. 
A sizable Igbo population is also found in Delta and Rivers States. 
Large ethnic Igbo populations are found in Cameroon, Gabon, and 
Equatorial Guinea, as well as outside Africa. There has been 
much speculation about the origins of the Igbo people, which are largely 
unknown. Geographically, the Igbo homeland is divided into two unequal sections 
by the Niger River—an eastern (which is the larger of the two) and a 
western section.[28][29] The Igbo people are one of the largest ethnic 
groups in Africa.
